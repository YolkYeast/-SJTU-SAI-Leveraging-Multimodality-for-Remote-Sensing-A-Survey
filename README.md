## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of references for the final project on **"Leveraging Multimodality for Remote Sensing"**. The project explores the evolution and application of multimodal approaches in remote sensing, from traditional multimodal vision techniques to modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

### Key Topics:
- **Multimodal Vision**: Traditional and modern approaches to combining multiple data modalities in remote sensing
- **Multimodal Large Language Models**: Recent advances in MLLMs for understanding and processing remote sensing data
- **Remote Sensing Applications**: Practical applications across various domains (agriculture, urban planning, disaster management, etc.)
